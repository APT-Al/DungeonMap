# Please, Follow the below Rules

We have to obey the rules for clean and maintanable codes.

### Why should we have done these

Different modules specified in the design document are coded in the Coding phase according to the module specification. The main goal of the coding phase is to code from the design document prepared after the design phase through a high-level language and then to unit test this code.

Good software development organizations want their programmers to maintain to some well-defined and standard style of coding called coding standards. They usually make their own coding standards and guidelines depending on what suits their organization best and based on the types of software they develop. It is very important for the programmers to maintain the coding standards otherwise the code will be rejected during code review.

### Purpose of Having Coding Standards:

- A coding standard gives a uniform appearance to the codes written by different engineers.
- It improves readability, and maintainability of the code and it reduces complexity also.
- It helps in code reuse and helps to detect error easily. 
- It promotes sound programming practices and increases efficiency of the programmers.

### Classes
- ClassName

### Function
- functionName

### Varible
- variable_name
- #### Temp Varible
    - _temp_variable_name

### Indentation

```
function(){
    ???
}

```

### Git Commit Style
- related place :: your commit 
    - For example > AESCipher :: encryption bug solved
